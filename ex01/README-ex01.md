## 3D Printing Projects - Example 1
  
# Approach
Sketched large circle on the XY plane   
Sketched large circle in the center  
Extended a line from the top and botomm apex to the outer ring  
Trimmed the outer ring to form the opening  
Skteched three smaller circles on the same plane  
Padded out the closed object  
Punched out the three small three holes  
Created a mesh file for slicing  
  
# Alternate approaches
Could use a pocket to punch out a sketched rectangle  
  
# First principles skills I picked up

# Overall impression
Generally a single dimensional object with not complex shapes
