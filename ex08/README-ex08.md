# 3D Printing Projects - Example 8
  
## Approach
Sketched two mirroed circles and smaller ones for holes   
Centered a rectangle about the y axis as the stem   
Added tangent circles on top and sides anchoring to the stem and each other  
Connected all points, trimmed the excess to make a key shape  
Padded it out 

## First principles skills I picked up  
Leveraging the sklils of the previous projects: tangents, mirrors, axies, pockets  

## Overall impression  
Good challenge so far, mastering the current known skills    

## Alternate approaches
to be determined
