# 3D Printing Projects - Example 8
  
## Approach
Sketched two mirroed circles and smaller ones for holes   
Centered a rectangle about the y axis as the stem   
Added tangent circles on top and sides anchoring to the stem and each other  
Connected all points, trimmed the excess to make a key shape  
Padded it out 
Sketched, padded and pocketed the center slot on the XZ plane  
Sketched, padded and pocketed the final stem on the XY plane  
Set the colors  

## First principles skills I picked up  
Leveraging the sklils of the previous projects: tangents, mirrors, axis's, holes and pockets  
It also required sketches on the XY and XZ planes 

## Overall impression  
Good challenge so far, mastering the current known skills    

## Alternate approaches
need to check on the length of the key slot, visually the stem seems slightly shortened
