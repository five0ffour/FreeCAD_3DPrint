# 3D Printing Projects - Example 9
  
## Approach
Used Part Design to create an involute gear but couldn't get the involute gear to work as it seems to assume bevel gears. Next I googled and found a square tooth gear macro that someone created using arrays. It looks like it can do the job if I do my math correctly.  

## First principles skills I picked up  
Involute gear   
Macros  
Arrays  

## Overall impression  
A tough one in FreeCAD. The involute gear feature doesn't seem to support square teeth. I need to do it manually, but yikes.
