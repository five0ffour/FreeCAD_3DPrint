# 3D Printing Projects - Example 11
  
## Approach
Created the three reference circles and aligned them accordingly  
Outlined them all using straight lines and tangents  
Added the oval cut-out to the left  
Padded to length  
Sketched an offset plane, the three smallest inner circles and punched them through  
Sketched an offset plane, out the three wider circles and only punched 1/2 way through  

## First principles skills I picked up  
These are variations on the same themes    
multiple layers, padding depths, offsets, reference cirlces, holes, tangents  

## Overall impression   
This one was quick work having done the other 10 exercises. If not for those, this is mostly a two dimensional object.  

## Alternate approaches
Could try to do this with baseline rectangles then fillet the edges
