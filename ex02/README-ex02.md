# 3D Printing Projects - Example 2
  
## Approach
Sketched out a base plate with an oval slot  
Padded it out  
Filleted the corner  
Sketched out a second rectange on the same plane offset on the z axes and added a slot  
Padded it out and filleted the corners  
Colored the model  
Created a slicer mesh   
  
## First principles skills I picked up
Oval slots  
Fillets  
Z-axis offsets  

## Overall impression
A simple two plane object with fillets. The garrish multi-color scheme matches the book!  

## Alternate approaches
Could have used a YZ plane for the second sketch
