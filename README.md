# FreeCAD_3DPrint
FreeCAD 3D Print models developed from Cardin360 3D Printing Book
  
This repository captures my FreeCAD project solutions to the exercises listed in the book "3D Printing Projects: 200 3D Practice Drawings For 3D Printing On Your 3D Printer" by Sachidanand Jha

## What is FreeCAD?  
FreeCAD is an open source software tool for digitally designing and modeling 3 dimensional objects. It is an powerful tool supported by an active community that allows anyone to learn computer aided design. There are plenty of modeling tools out there, and even other open source projects for the CAD space. I chose FreeCAD for its engineering approach, user interface, active community, and ability to interface with the 3D printer slicing software.

## My Goal - 3D Printing
Having grown up around mechanical engineers, manufacturing and old school drafters, I was always facinated with how they achieved their craft. 3D printing and the affordailty of at home printers for hobbyists took away the final hurdle. The software and hardware come together to allow me to join the maker community to concieve, design and create prototype objects at home. I am using the software, youTube and digital content to push myself to learn these basic skills. 
  
## This project
That is where this project comes in. Having found the book "3D PRINTING PROJECTS: 200 3D Practice Drawings For 3D Printing On Your 3D Printer by Sachidanand Jha", I endeavor to use these examples to practice and hone my craft of mastering a CAD tool to design components... a long journey to be sure. I am not a professional CAD engineer, so I don't expect these projects to be the most efficient solution to the problems. That being said, as I get better I will likely come back and adjust these to reflect my learnings. If anyone can leverage any value out of my practice, then that is the beauty of git and the internet.

## Future Enhancements
1. Complete the projects as I get to them
2. Include notes with each exercise giving the tips & tricks for that individual challenge
3. Update the effiency of each solution as I get better at my craft
4. Include slicer files for anyone wishing to print a 3D rendering of the examples, where practical
